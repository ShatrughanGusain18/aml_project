2. **Using CleverHans for Adversarial Attacks**
3. **Building and Retraining a DNN Model**
4. **Performing and Mitigating Adversarial Attacks**

### 1. Introduction to Adversarial Machine Learning (AML)

Adversarial Machine Learning involves techniques where attackers craft inputs to deceive machine learning models, causing them to make incorrect predictions. Common types of attacks include:

- **Evasion Attacks**: Inputs are crafted to evade detection by a trained model.
- **Poisoning Attacks**: Training data is tampered with, compromising the modelâ€™s integrity.

### 2. Using CleverHans for Adversarial Attacks

CleverHans is a popular library for adversarial machine learning research. It includes implementations of various attack methods such as FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Method), PGD (Projected Gradient Descent), and more.

#### Getting Started with CleverHans

- **Installation**: 
  ```bash
  pip install cleverhans
  ```

- **Basic Usage**:
  ```python
  from cleverhans.attacks import fast_gradient_method
  import tensorflow as tf

  model = ...  # your trained model
  x = ...  # input data
  y = ...  # true labels

  # Perform FGSM attack
  adv_x = fast_gradient_method(model, x, eps=0.3, norm=np.inf)
  ```

### 3. Building and Retraining a DNN Model

#### Building the Model

- Use popular frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch to build your DNN model.
- Example in TensorFlow:
  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf

  model = tf.keras.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_shape=(input_shape,)),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_classes, activation='softmax')
  ])

  model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
  ```

#### Training the Model

- Train the model with your dataset:
  ```python
  model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(val_data, val_labels))
  ```

#### Retraining with Adversarial Data

- Generate adversarial examples using CleverHans.
- Retrain the model with a mix of original and adversarial data to enhance its robustness:
  ```python
  adv_data = fast_gradient_method(model, train_data, eps=0.3, norm=np.inf)
  combined_data = np.concatenate((train_data, adv_data))
  combined_labels = np.concatenate((train_labels, train_labels))  # use the same labels

  model.fit(combined_data, combined_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(val_data, val_labels))
  ```

### 4. Performing and Mitigating Adversarial Attacks

#### Performing Adversarial Attacks

- Use CleverHans to perform different types of attacks:
  ```python
  from cleverhans.attacks import projected_gradient_descent

  adv_x = projected_gradient_descent(model, x, eps=0.3, eps_iter=0.01, nb_iter=40, norm=np.inf)
  ```

#### Mitigating Adversarial Attacks

- **Adversarial Training**: Include adversarial examples in the training process.
- **Defensive Distillation**: Train the model at different temperature settings to smooth the gradients.
- **Gradient Masking**: Obscure gradients to make it harder for attackers to craft adversarial examples.
